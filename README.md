# CV_Interface
Communication API for CV to use

Different but equivalent bench setups
- TWO_ARDUINO_SETUP
    - Two arduinos connected to each other and also computer
    - Scanner_Arduino is the specialized code for scanner arduino
- ARDUINO_RPI_SETUP
    - RPi connected to Arduino
## Arduino Test Circuit Diagram
Button setup is the same as the one described in https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples/Button
Whenever the button is pressed, arduino will send a set-mode request.
